# WagWatch

Welcome to WagWatch!

WagWatch is a site where pet sitters and pet owners can sign up to Wag or Watch! The Waggers(owners) will be able to build their profiles to coordinate personalized care for their pets. The Watchers(sitters) will be able to build their profiles to display their pet sitting experience. This site was a great exercise in learning how to deploy applications to Heroku using MYSQL and JAWSDB. We also learned how to merge using git, and using npm and node.js, we learned how to load our third-party API's for dog and cat of the day. We also have a schema database complete with an .env file and bcrypt to keep passwords secure. We wrapped it all up in a nice look using Tailwind's CSS library.
